# Models for compliant bumper

Folder with training for RNN model of the compliant bumper and its comparison with the SVR model.

-------------

## Jupyter Notebooks
- **search_RNN_hyperparam.ipynb** contains the training instructions for RNN model.
- **train_RNN.ipynb** contains the training instructions for RNN model.
- **comparison.ipynb** compares the RNN model with SVR model using the real-time python controller used for experiments.

## Running Instructions
All the notebooks can be run using Google Colaboratory. Set the `Hardware accelerator` to `GPU` in `Edit>Notebook settings`.
